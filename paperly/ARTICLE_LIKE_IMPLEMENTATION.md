# Article Like Feature Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the article viewing and liking feature for logged-in users in the Paperly mobile app.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Backend Implementation

1. **Database Schema** (Already existed in `001_paperly_master_schema.sql`)
   - `paperly.articles` table with like_count field
   - `paperly.article_likes` table for user-article like relationships
   - `paperly.article_stats` table for cached statistics
   - Unique constraint on (user_id, article_id) for idempotent likes

2. **Like Service** (`/apps/backend/src/application/services/like.service.ts`)
   - `likeArticle()` - Add like (idempotent)
   - `unlikeArticle()` - Remove like (idempotent)
   - `toggleLike()` - Toggle like status
   - `getUserLikeStatus()` - Get current user's like status
   - `getArticleLikeCount()` - Get total like count

3. **Like Repository** (`/apps/backend/src/infrastructure/repositories/like.repository.ts`)
   - PostgreSQL implementation with transactions
   - Automatic like count updates in article_stats table
   - Proper error handling and logging

4. **Mobile Article Controller** (`/apps/backend/src/infrastructure/web/controllers/mobile-article.controller.ts`)
   - GET `/api/mobile/articles` - List published articles with pagination
   - GET `/api/mobile/articles/:id` - Get article details
   - POST `/api/mobile/articles/:id/like` - Like article
   - DELETE `/api/mobile/articles/:id/like` - Unlike article
   - POST `/api/mobile/articles/:id/toggle-like` - Toggle like
   - GET `/api/mobile/articles/:id/like-status` - Get like status
   - All endpoints require authentication for like operations

5. **Container Registration** (`/apps/backend/src/infrastructure/config/container.ts`)
   - Registered LikeService, LikeRepository, ArticleStatsRepository
   - Registered MobileArticleController

### Mobile App Implementation

1. **Article Models** (`/apps/mobile/lib/models/article_models.dart`)
   - `Article` model with all necessary fields
   - `LikeData` model for like status and count
   - `ArticleListResponse` for paginated lists
   - Proper JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Support for both snake_case and camelCase field mapping

2. **Article Service** (`/apps/mobile/lib/services/article_service.dart`)
   - Complete API client for all article operations
   - Like/unlike/toggle functionality
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Logging for debugging

3. **Article List Screen** (`/apps/mobile/lib/screens/article_list_screen.dart`)
   - Infinite scroll with pagination
   - Real-time like functionality
   - Pull-to-refresh
   - Search and filtering support
   - Responsive design with Muji theme
   - Haptic feedback for interactions

4. **Article Detail Screen** (`/apps/mobile/lib/screens/article_detail_screen.dart`)
   - Rich article viewing experience
   - Prominent like button with animation
   - Reading progress indicator
   - Author information display
   - Real-time like count updates

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### Idempotent Like System
- Users can only like an article once (database constraint)
- Multiple like requests return current status without error
- Automatic like count synchronization

### Real-time Updates
- Like counts update immediately in UI
- Optimistic updates with error rollback
- Cache management for like status

### Authentication Integration
- All like operations require valid JWT token
- Graceful handling for non-authenticated users
- Clear messaging about login requirements

### User Experience
- Smooth animations for like actions
- Haptic feedback for interactions
- Loading states and error handling
- Consistent Muji-style design

### Performance Optimizations
- Cached like status to reduce API calls
- Efficient pagination for article lists
- Optimized database queries with indexes

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

To test the complete flow:

1. **Login Flow**
   - Register/login a user account
   - Verify JWT token is stored and sent with requests

2. **Article Browsing**
   - Navigate to article list screen
   - Verify articles load with pagination
   - Test pull-to-refresh functionality

3. **Like Functionality**
   - Tap like button on article (should show liked state)
   - Tap again to unlike (should show unliked state)
   - Verify like count updates in real-time
   - Check that like status persists after app restart

4. **Article Detail**
   - Navigate to article detail from list
   - Verify full article content loads
   - Test like functionality in detail view
   - Verify like count matches between list and detail

5. **Error Scenarios**
   - Test with no internet connection
   - Test with invalid/expired token
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly

```

### Database Tables Used
- `paperly.articles` - Article information with cached like_count
- `paperly.article_likes` - User-article like relationships
- `paperly.article_stats` - Detailed article statistics

### Response Format
